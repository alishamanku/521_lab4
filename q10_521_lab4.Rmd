## Hello there

This presentation will show you how to plot a vector .

![](https://relatably.com/m/img/over-excited-memes/g1391797573406916835.jpg)

## Steps

-   Create any vector , For example V\<-( 3,4,5)
-   use plot(vector_name) to see know the graph looks. For example plot(v)

## Code-1

Now in the RStudio lets create a vector and plot it.

r graph plotting

\# Define the cars vector with 5 values

cars \<- c(10, 33, 16, 34, 15)

\# Graph the cars vector with all defaults

plot(cars)

## Output-1

```{r Graph plots for car}
# Define the cars vector with 5 values
cars <- c(10, 33, 16, 34, 15)

# Graph the cars vector with all defaults
plot(cars)
```

## Code-2

Now in the RStudio lets create a vector and plot it with height and width of the graph as we mention.

r fig.height=10, fig.width=5

\# Define the cars vector with 5 values

cars \<- c(10, 33, 16, 34, 15)

\# Graph the cars vector with all defaults

plot(cars)

## Output-2

```{r fig.height=10, fig.width=5}

# Define the cars vector with 5 values
cars <- c(10, 33, 16, 34, 15)

# Graph the cars vector with all defaults
plot(cars)

```

## Now its your turn, Let's plot!!

Thank you for sticking by till the end, hope you enjoyed learning how to plot a vector.
